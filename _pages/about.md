I am an Italian theoretical Physicist currently working as an academic in Chile. My education is in Experimental and Theoretical Physics, Cambridge University UK, specializing in high energy theoretical Physics. I completed my PhD in String Theory from Queen Mary University of London and then proceeded to work as a post-doctoral reseachers in Latin America, at Universidad Nacional de La Plata (Argentinca) first, and then moving to Centro Estudios Cientificos (CECs) (Chile). I am currently an associate Professor of physics at Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Santiago, Chile. 

My research interests are mainly in Soliton Physics, Holography and the fine line between Computer Science and Physics. In particular, this has led me to build a large experience in coding, which is an essential part of my everyday research practice. I am an expert in Wolfram Language, which I use for symbolic manipulation in Physics and Numerical solving of PDEs. For my numerical simulations I also code in Python, where I have easier access to calculations that require GPUs. I have experience in Neural Networks and even adapted these to solve PDEs in an adaptive mesh refinement scenario (see my Wolfram community post [here](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2852243)).

Coding is my personal hobby too. For fun, I coded my own personal Robo-Advisor for financial investments, using Machine Learning algorithms from the Chilean database of consumer practices. As it turns out, my advisor performs better than the current ones in the local market! (you can find my Robo-Advisor project in my [Portfolio](https://giannitallarita.github.io/portfolio/))
