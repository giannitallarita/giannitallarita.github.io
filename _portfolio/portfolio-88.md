This is a code I wrote to solve the singular Burgers' equation in one dimension using adaptive mesh refinement. The novel aspect of this code is the implementation with Neural Networks, meaning the solver can be passed to GPUs, dramatically speeding up the calculation. This code was awarded a Featured Contributor Badge on Wolfram's community group (see [link](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2852243)).

You can download the code [here](https://giannitallarita.github.io/files/AMRNeural.nb).
