This is the third and final project to construct my own financial Robo-advisor. In this program I implement a model that, for a fixed tolerance, specifies the percentage of each financial entity that should be added to your portfolio in order to maximize returns. 

You can download the code [here](https://giannitallarita.github.io/files/02-Porfolio_selector.ipynb).
