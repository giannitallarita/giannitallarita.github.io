This is a Python code where I code my own version of a CSV reading LLM agent. The idea behind this was to be able to not use the OpenAI() LLM subscription API and make it free. Clearly, the LLM model used needs to be much larger for better functionality. 

You can download the code [here](https://giannitallarita.github.io/files/myCsvLLMagent.ipynb).
