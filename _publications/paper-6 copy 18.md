We use a Yang-Mills field coupled to an axion as probes of a black hole with arbitrary Lifshitz scaling to investigate, via holography, superconducting phase transitions of the dual theory with a ⟨px+ipy⟩ condensate. In the relativistic case with no axion, this phase is known to be unstable, the stable phase corresponding to condensates of the ⟨px⟩ form. We investigate this stability in theories with nonrelativistic scaling. Finally we numerically compute the “Hall” conductivity of these black holes in the nonsuperconducting phase as a function of their Lifshitz scaling.
