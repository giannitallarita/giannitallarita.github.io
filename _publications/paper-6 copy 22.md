We investigate the effect of adding a Chern-Simons term coupled to an axion field to SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills in a fixed $AdS_4$/Schwarzschild background. We show that, when the axion has no potential, there is a phase transition between a Reissner-Nordstrom black-hole and one with a non-abelian condensate as per the vanishing Chern-Simons case. Furthermore, by giving the axion field a mass, one observes a phase transition between a Reissner-Nordstrom black-hole with axion hair to a 'superconducting' phase which also has a non-trivial axion profile. We are able to perform a preliminary analysis for this interesting case and observe that we can shift the critical temperature at which the phase transition occurs and observe interesting features of the order parameter scaling form.
