We explore vorton solutions in the Witten’s $U(1)×U(1)$ model for cosmic strings and in a modified version $U(1)×SO(3)$ obtained by introducing a triplet of non-Abelian fields to condense inside the string. We restrict to the case in which the unbroken symmetry in the bulk remains global. The vorton solutions are found numerically for certain choices of parameters and compared with an analytical solutions obtained in the thin vorton limit. We also discuss the vorton decay into Q-rings (or spinning Q-balls) and, to some extent, the time dependent behavior of vortons above the charge threshold.
