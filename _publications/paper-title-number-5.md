We investigate vortex lattice solutions in a holographic superconductor model in asymptotically $AdS_4$ spacetime which includes the gravitational backreaction of the vortex. The circular cell approximation, which is known to give a good result for several physical quantities in the Ginzburg-Landau model, is used. The critical magnetic fields and the magnetization curve are computed. The vortex lattice profiles are compared to expectations from the Abrikosov solution in the regime nearby the upper critical magnetic field $H_{2c}$ for which superconductivity is lost.
