We find, by an appropriate extension of the standard holographic superconductor setup, static bulk solutions which describe holographic duals to non-Abelian vortices. In the core of these vortices, a scalar field condenses, breaking a non-Abelian global symmetry, which leads to additional zero modes called orientational moduli. These moduli appear in the bulk as Goldstone bosons associated to the condensation of a neutral scalar field.
