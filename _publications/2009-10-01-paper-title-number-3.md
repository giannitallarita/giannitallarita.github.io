In the presence of a scalar hair perturbation, the Cauchy horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black hole disappears and is replaced by the rapid collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, which leads to a Kasner singularity [1, 2]. We study the time-dependence of holographic complexity, both for the volume and for the action proposals, in a class of models with hairy black holes. Volume complexity can only probe a portion of the black hole interior that remains far away from the Kasner singularity. We provide numerical evidence that the Lloyd bound is satisfied by the volume complexity rate in all the parameter space that we explored. Action complexity can instead probe a portion of the spacetime closer to the singularity. In particular, the complexity rate diverges at the critical time $t_c$ for which the Wheeler-DeWitt patch touches the singularity. After the critical time the action complexity rate approaches a constant. We find that the Kasner exponent does not directly affect the details of the divergence of the complexity rate at $t = t_c$ and the late-time behaviour of the complexity. The Lloyd bound is violated by action complexity at finite time, because the complexity rate diverges at $t = t_c$. We find that the Lloyd bound is satisfied by the asymptotic action complexity rate in all the parameter space that we investigated.
