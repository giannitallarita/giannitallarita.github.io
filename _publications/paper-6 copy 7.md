We study a fully back-reacted non-abelian vortex solution in an extension of the holographic superconductor setup. The thermodynamic properties of the vortex are computed. We show that, in some regime of parameters, the non-abelian vortex solution has a lower free energy than a competing abelian vortex solution. The solution is dual to a finite-temperature perturbed conformal field theory with a topological defect, on which operators related to the Goldstone modes of a spontaneously broken symmetry are localized. We compute numerically the retarded Green function of these operators and we find, in the classical approximation in the bulk, a gapless $ℂℙ^1$ excitation on the vortex world line.
