We continue the study of U(1) vortices with cholesteric vacuum structure. A new class of solutions is found which represent global vortices of the internal spin field. These spin vortices are characterized by a non-vanishing angular dependence at spatial infinity, or winding. We show that despite the topological Z2 behavior of SO(3) windings, the topological charge of the spin vortices is of the Z type in the cholesteric. We find these solutions numerically and discuss the properties derived from their low energy effective field theory in 1+1 dimensions.
