We study a U(1) × U(1) gauge theory discussing its vortex solutions and supersymmetric extension. In our set-up, the dynamics of one of two Abelian gauge fields is governed by a Maxwell term, the other by a Chern–Simons term. The two sectors interact via a BF gauge field mixing and a Higgs portal term that connects the two complex scalars. We also consider the supersymmetric version of this system which allows to find for the bosonic sector BPS equations in which an additional real scalar field enters into play. We study numerically the field equations finding vortex solutions with both magnetic flux and electric charge.
