We study a spontaneously broken SU(2) Chern-Simons-Higgs model coupled though a Higgs portal to an uncharged triplet scalar with a vacuum state competing with the Higgs one. We find vortexlike solutions to the field equations in different parameter space regions. Depending on the scalar coupling constants, we find a parameter region in which the competing order creates a halo about the Chern-Simons-Higgs vortex core, together with two other regions, one where no vortex solutions exist and the other where ordinary Chern-Simons-Higgs vortices can be found. We derive the low-energy theory for the moduli fields on the vortex world sheet and also discuss the connection of our results with those found in studies of competing orders in high-temperature superconductors.
